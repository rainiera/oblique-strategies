          Oblique Strategies, originally presented as a pack of cards,
          were by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. Each Oblique Strategy is
          a phrase or cryptic remark which can be used to break a creative
          deadlock or dilemma situation.
          This website presents a random Oblique Strategy selected from
          editions 1â€“5.
